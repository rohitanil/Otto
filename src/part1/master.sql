Semiconductors are miniaturized integrated circuits comprising numerous components. The semiconductor manufacturing process begins with the thin disc-shaped silicon wafers. On each wafer, up to thousands of identical chips can be prepared depending upon the diameter of the wafer to build up the circuits layer by layer in a wafer fab. The size of the semiconductors requires a high number of units to be produced, thus necessitating a large amount of data to control for improving the semiconductor manufacturing process. Therefore, the collection and analysis of the equipment data, process data, and machine history data throughout the manufacturing process are required to diagnose faults, monitor the process, and manage the manufacturing process effectively. This research is focused on improving the semiconductor manufacturing process through a rigorous analysis of collected manufacturing process data, employing statistical process control (SPC), data mining techniques, and data-driven decision models.

The optoelectronic properties of DPs are, however, compromised. This work provides a methodology for improving the photophysical properties of DPs and achieving high-efficiency warm white light emission. First principles density functional theory (DFT) was used in material design and the ligand-free synthesis of halide DP Cs2Ag1−xKxIn0.875Bi0.125Cl6 (x ≤ 0.60) via a facile recrystallization process was demonstrated. The compositional tuning of K+ to Ag+ resulted in an improvement in photo- physical properties. Independent of K+ content, all the samples exhibit strong absorption at a wavelength of λmax ∼ 375 nm with a direct bandgap which is consistent with our DFT calculation results. Broadband photoluminescence (PL) emission profiles covering the spectra from blue to deep red (405–820 nm at λmax ∼ 629 nm) were observed. Besides, with an optimized K+ alloying content of 0.20, the optical performance of these halide DPs was impressively regulated, demonstrating improved photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of host Cs2AgInCl6 crystals from ∼ 2.70 % (x = 0) to ∼15.96 % (x = 0.20), due to increased radiative recombination of self-trapped excitons. the highest report for such structures.

Besides establishing ultimate limits, we also show that the composable secret-key rate achievable by a suitable (pilot-guided and postselected) coherent-state protocol is sufficiently close to these limits, therefore showing the suitability of free-space channels for high-rate quantum key distribution.

The functionality and efficiency of today\'s sensors, which operate in a manner similar to physical sensing, are frequently constrained by their hardware and software. In this research, we proposed the Parallel Sensing framework, which includes background, concept, basic methods and typical application of parallel sensing. In our formulation, sensors are redefined as the integration of real physical sensors and virtual software-defined sensors based on parallel intelligence, in order to boost the performance of the sensors. Each sensor will have a parallel counterpart in the virtual world within the framework of parallel sensing. Digital sensors serve as the brain of sensors and maintain the same properties as physical sensors. Parallel sensing allows physical sensors to operate in discrete time periods to conserve energy, while cloud-based descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive sensors operate continuously to offer compensation data and serve as guardians. To better illustrate parallel sensing concept, we show some example applications of parallel sensing such as parallel vision, parallel point cloud and parallel light fields, both of which are designed by construct virtual sensors to extend small real data to virtual big data and then boost the performance of perception models. Experimental results demonstrate the effective of parallel sensing framework.

Two specific techniques are developed: (1) Leakage power behavior is examined for reordering serially connected transistor blocks. Based on that, we can then determine a primary input vector to a circuit to reduce its leakage power during idle mode. (2) Effect of body bias is studied for nano-scale transistor. A hybrid technique (mixing reverse body bias and forward body bias) is developed to reduce power leakage during idle mode. Another current work that a doctoral student and I are working on is to develop a tool for software debugging and verification. Traditional IDE allows setting of break points, but provides minimum supports in reasoning and bug locating. The goal of this research work is to allow programmers to query various properties of programs and help locating the causes of property violations. Another current work that a doctoral student and I are working on is to design a transistor level circuit simulator, which gives an accuracy near that of SPICE, and can handles much larger circuits in much less run time. Other research work involves distributed data sharing and collaboration, design of platform and protocol for emergency response systems, etc.\nTeaching Interests:\nVLSI timing analysis\nVLSI computer-aided design\nTransistor level leakage power reduction\nMultimedia information systems\nModeling and performance evaluation of computer/communication systems\nObject-oriented databases\nComputer networks\nParallel/distributed processing\nComputer architecture\nSelect Publications:\nDon P.

Their behavior is governed by physics at multiple length scales – from molecular, to typical dimension characterizing the individual phase boundary, to macroscale on which the microstructure is changing. Understanding of these systems in general can be improved through use of numerical simulations of appropriate phenomena at various lengthscales, theories for multiscale modeling, and experiments. Our research focuses on development of efficient algorithms for numerical simulations and theory. We apply these to variety of multiphase problems, and compare the predictions with experiments carried out either by our collaborators or available in the literature.\nTeaching Interests:\nFluid Mechanics, Transport Phenomena\nThermodynamics\nTransport in Biological Systems\nProcess Control\nApplied Mathematics\nSelect Publications:\nSangani, A.

Our success in utilizing our water resources infrastructure to reduce damages associated with the variable hydroclimate depends on our ability to diagnose and predict this hydroclimate variability at timescales which are relevant for adaptive management. This task is hampered by spatial and temporal sparsity of observations of hydrologic and hydroclimatic flux, complex patterns of space/time covariability in observations, and extremely low signal-to-noise ratio in hydroclimatic systems at the local scale. My research seeks to combat these obstacles by 1) integrating new sources of observational data, mostly from space-based assets, into diagnostic/predictive frameworks of hydrologic/hydroclimatic flux; 2) grounding data-driven analysis in a physical understanding of the hydrologic system through feature engineering and model diagnostics; 3) developing and utilizing data science algorithms which are appropriate for multivariate space/time systems, and 4) quantifying bias, error, and uncertainty in space/time models. Applications include automatic flood detection from multispectral and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery for disaster response (NASA/USGS/NGA), developing custom hydrometeorological forecasts for adaptive reservoir management, detecting drivers of hydroclimatic variability of the Great Lakes, and quantification of evapotranspiration and groundwater flux from space (NASA/USDA).\nRecent publications:\nCarter, E., Herrera, D.

While the generations of immune responses are complicated processes that involves wide range of molecular and cellular interactions, many key aspects crucial for protective immune responses have been recently revealed, generating enormous opportunities for therapeutic interventions to greatly improve patient health. Various immune engineering strategies based on biomaterial platforms have shown promise in facilitating immunogenic materials trafficking, modulating cellular interactions, and more. My previous work has also demonstrated several approaches to engineer coordinated cellular and humoral immune responses for augmenting therapeutic responses. The research of our team at Syracuse is aimed at designing biomaterials strategies to delivering molecular stimuli in a temporal and spatial fashion for regulating immune functions.

The global energy use is estimated to increase by ~60% while nearly 4 billion people are expected to live under severe water stress by 2050. Drinking water production from seawater is a highly energy intensive process and is inherently coupled with increased energy consumption. Thus, energy efficiency plays an ever more important and critical role in limiting energy demand growth. My research primarily focuses on two fundamental aspects of science and engineering which manifests into a wide variety of applications: 1) thermal management and energy conversion, and 2) water desalination. My research group at Syracuse University is highly multidisciplinary which conducts experiments, nano/micro scale fabrication, and performs molecular and continuum numerical simulations, in the areas of thermal management, heat transfer, energy conversion, transport phenomena, desalination, and optics.\nHonors:\n2015 NSF CAREER Award\nSelected Publications:\nSajag Poudel, An Zou & Shalabh C.
